For Assignment 3, I used simple Python rules so my BMI code is easy to read. I
named variables and functions with snake_case, which means lowercase words with
underscores, like weight_pounds, height_inches, and calculate_bmi, based on
PEP 8, https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/. I also wrote a short docstring under
each function to say what it does, based on PEP 257,
https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/. These rules help because the names make sense
and the small notes explain each function. For BMI categories, I used the CDC
adult BMI ranges so the category labels are from a trusted health source:
